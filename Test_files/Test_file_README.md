Steps to test the MGSE3.1.py script with the test file are as follows:

git clone https://github.com/bpucker/MGSE

cd Test_files

You can find different input files and reference region files here. 

Please read the script README for the usage of these different files.

NOTE: i) The fastq test file has long reads; If testing with this fastq file input, use minimap2 as the aligner.

      ii) The .bam test file is already sorted.
